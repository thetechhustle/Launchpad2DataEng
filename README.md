# Project-Based Data Engineering Learning

Welcome to our open-source project aimed at fostering practical data engineering skills! This project is inspired by the approach of breaking into data engineering with zero cost and a focus on hands-on projects. We will guide you through setting up a real-world data pipeline using modern tools and technologies like Python, BigQuery/Snowflake, and Astronomer. Whether you're a beginner looking to dive into data engineering or an experienced professional aiming to brush up on your skills, this project i...

## Overview

This project outlines a step-by-step approach to building a data engineering pipeline, from sourcing data to implementing quality checks. We focus on practical, project-based learning to equip you with the skills needed to excel in the field of data engineering.

### What You Will Build

- A Python script to fetch data from a REST API.
- A process to dump this data into a CSV file initially.
- A Snowflake or BigQuery setup to manage your data in the cloud.
- An automated pipeline using Astronomer to ingest data on a scheduled basis.
- Data quality checks to ensure the integrity of your data.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your machine.
- An account with Snowflake or BigQuery (free tiers are available).
- An account with Astronomer.

### Installation & Setup

1. **Find a Data Source**: Choose a data source you are interested in (e.g., stock market, Pok√©mon, sports data). Make sure it offers a REST API.
2. **Python Script for Data Fetching**: Clone this repository and navigate to the script directory. Modify the script to point to your chosen data source.
3. **Snowflake/BigQuery Account**: Follow the instructions on their website to set up a free trial account. Modify the script to dump data into your Snowflake/BigQuery instance instead of a CSV.
4. **Astronomer for Automation**: Set up an account and follow the instructions to automate your data ingestion.
5. **Data Quality Checks**: Implement data quality checks using Great Expectations or your custom checks.

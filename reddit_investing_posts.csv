I am a 24 year old with a degree and finance and work as a full time actor. I am fortunate enough to have the ability to pay my bills with the grace of putting some away in savings (5.5% APY) while living in California. 

I am super proud of the position I am in financially, but want to know what someone progressive would do to keep the money circulating and growing. Based on the following below, what would be a very reasonable investment to profit from?

- 24 year old
- living in Cali
- 790 credit score
- $30,000 in savings 
- $12,000 401(k)
- Annual income: ~$60k
- Monthly expenses: ~$3,700

"When stocks are sold at a high price for profit, who is it sold to",FarAd336,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ffzaai/when_stocks_are_sold_at_a_high_price_for_profit/,1726245686.0,"Let me put in some context here. Imagine a company selling their stocks of an item that has reached a price of 100 dollars that had previously been 50. When the company sees the mass profit of this price, they sell it. But who would buy that stock at that price, knowing it's an expense and it is unrealistic for it to be profitable over and over again. Not all items can be having rising prices forever and making profit for those who stocks are sold to. 

Example, a company buys chocolate stocks. Each chocolate bar is 2 dollars. After buying the stocks and waiting for a sweet spot, the price reaches 6 dollars. The stocks are sold, but the investor who buys these stocks, how would they make any profit from a 6 dollar chocolate bar since increasing that price would be ridiculously expensive for an average person who buys groceries in a commercial market."

Is it smart to sell stocks now and then to grab the profit and then immediately re-invest?,Esdoornhelikoptertje,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ffz233/is_it_smart_to_sell_stocks_now_and_then_to_grab/,1726245107.0,"We are having this discussion here if let's say you buy stocks, they go up 20%. You sell them to grab the profit. Then re-invest the capital plus gains so any next unrealised losses are on the entire capital including profit instead of only on your initial capital. Does this makes your portfolio not grow much faster? 

The plan would be to sell all the stocks as soon as they reach 20, 30, or more percent and then immediately re-purchase them. Some stay this isn't any better than just holding the stocks. But I disagree, but I have difficulty getting the formulas right. I get that a bad year would still have effect, but good years will have a much better effect than for someone who held right, because the profit is now fixated? If stocks rise again by 20%, it will be an a lot more money? "
Value investing in (UK) life insurance companies,Pipthagoras,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ffwqk1/value_investing_in_uk_life_insurance_companies/,1726239295.0,"If I'm not mistaken, comparing the book value of (UK) life insurance companies is not straightforwards and punished accounts are of limited use to this end.

Most insurers invest heavily in illiquid private assets which have no observable market value, so asset values will be spurious. Sure they can discount expected asset cashflows, but allowances for credit risk in these calculations will require expert judgment and will vary from company-to-company.

Similarly, liability values are based on assumptions which are not published (or at-least not with sufficient granularity and alongside the demographic make-up of liability portfolios to validate quoted liability values). If I can't compare the mortality assumptions, for example, made by 2 different companies then how can I compare the quoted values of their liabilities?

With such long-tailed assets and liabilities and no disclosure of assumptions or valuation approaches, how does one objectively compare the accounts of two life insurers? Obviously regulation such as IFRS17 \_should\_ make accounts comparable, but only to a limited extent since the level of prudence used by different insurers will vary.

  
I've stipulated that this question relates to UK life insurers because I have a vague understanding of how UK life insurers accounts are prepared - but the question may well relate to various types of insurance company in various countries for all I know."

India is projected to be one of the fastest-growing economies over the next few decades, driven by its young population, technological advancements, and economic reforms.

This Northwestern Mutual advisor (a friend sells insurance for them and offered a free meeting with one of their actual financial advisors, so I figured why not). Got in a long discussion about funds he believes in and why. He was preaching American Funds up and down. 

Not my first time hearing the American Funds speech, but he sent me this article by them outright stating they beat out the S&amp;P in the long term by QUITE A BIT. I was a bit taken back by it. Reading over the article multiple times I still don’t necessarily understand the article and the math behind it. It feels like Cheerios telling me breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Or Welch’s telling me a glass of juice will make me live longer. Just seems like they would skew an article like this any way they could to boost investments.

It is a long article and a lot to take in, but interesting nonetheless and would love to see some critiques by people smarter than me as to what they think.

In my opinion American Funds specifically the growth fund of America has done historically well. Especially navigating the dot com bubble which really helps skew their lifetime data on how it compares. Navigating other financial crises they have done relatively average. All while charging high front end loads and ER’s. But never would think that over the long term it would be that much better than the S&amp;P.

On the 8th of August I required via email a transfer of positions from Trade Republic to Interactive Brokers.
They only recently got back with me (11th of September), telling me what I will sum up by ""we've been very busy sorry for the delay, but we're taking care of it now""

Okay then ! I replied asking if they had an estimation of how long it would take for the transfer to finally be executed.

Their answer, summed up :

- your demand has *now* been *treated*
- please understand it can take a few weeks
- you can read more about why in this article (which I can't link in this sub, it was a BaFin article)

Now what's interesting is that I actually went and read the article, which provided the following infos :

- According to the **Securities Trading Act (WpHG), article 69**, transfer orders must be executed ""immediatly and honnestly"". However this meant different things for companies and individuals, which led to an increase in complaints in 2020/2021

- Which then led to **article 63 of the WpHG** stating that these transfers must be executed within 3 weeks. If the company fails to do so for whatever reason, they have to inform the customer immediatly after this delay (within 5 business days after delay expiry)

- this was linked to a decision of Munich's superior tribunal, which considered that a company had ""failed in its obligations"" past this delay. **( OLG ) (19 U 1687/06)**

Now, in my case... Their last delay to notify me was on September 5th (accounting for the 5 business days period). They only sent me an email back on the 11th. On top of that, what I'm afraid is happening is that they are only processing this request now, which means I have to wait an extra ""few weeks"" (their terms), during which they told me it was critical not to sell my shares because it'd result in having to buy them back to cover the position etc.

What's annoying is that I was already frowning about these delays as the stock I'm transfering is very volatile and I believe could spike soon, which means I'd want to sell. But now, extra delay ?

So, I'm wondering if what I understood is correct, and if there's anything I can say/do in hopes of making this quicker, as they are not compliant with the regulations. Thanks so much for anyone who could light my lantern and help me with this, and have a great day !"

here is what I did.

Following the end of june discussion, I invested all liquid cash into a bucket of stocks and took the risk of a market downturn.

I sold 2/3 of the mortgage amount of stocks around August 28th and realized some small gains about 0.8% gain and paid 2/3 of the mortagage balance. slightly beat the interest income i could earn from treasury account and had way more flexibility

My equities position currently has respectively 2% unrealized loss and 2.4% unrealized loss in 2 accounts.

my worst performing stocks are

1. crwd, and every one knows why..
2. qcom
3. Amat.

Conclusion:

It feels to me it’s actually worth the risk of investing in equities since market can easily beat the mortgage rate with the volatility in market.

I could have gained 8% if i would have sold crwd at the beginning of July…

Just to spur some discussion for a heavily tilted discssion. At that time in June, 3/4 of redditoors said I should pay off the 7.885% mortgage.. I did the reverse.. "

" It’s easy to buy gold, how /where do I sell it?",moonbunR,158,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ff40k9/its_easy_to_buy_gold_how_where_do_i_sell_it/,1726151535.0,"A lot of people talk about how easy it is to buy gold—whether it’s from big retailers like Costco, online dealers, or even local shops. However, once you’ve accumulated gold bars or coins, the big question becomes: how do you sell it, and where?

For example, who buys gold from individuals like us? Is there a marketplace or a network of dealers who are specifically interested in purchasing gold? And how is the selling price determined? I know the gold market has fluctuating spot prices, but does that fully control what you’ll be paid? Are there fees or deductions to expect from the buyer, and if so, how do those typically work?

Another thing I’m curious about is the process itself. Is selling as straightforward as walking into a shop or dealer with your gold bars, or is it more involved? Do you need certain paperwork or certificates of authenticity to get the best value? For those who’ve gone through it, how was your experience? Were there any surprises, such as the buyer's inspection process or additional costs like testing?

I’m asking because I’ve heard mixed opinions. Some say the resale market can be a bit tricky due to premiums, buyer fees, and market demand. Others say it’s as simple as finding a trusted dealer or listing it on a marketplace. I’m interested in hearing about real experiences from anyone who has sold their gold bars or coins. How did you find a buyer, and was the process smooth or difficult? "

Then after another year you get 4% of that and it grows exponentially year after year. 

But how does this work in an IRA? You don't gain interest, the stock is just worth more over time. And with reinvesting dividends being such a small amount, I don't understand how this grows exponentially. This makes it seem to me that a Roth IRA is just a regular brokerage acct, just one you don't pay taxes on in the back end.

ETFs: Physical Certificate or DRS?,JusticeForSimpleRick,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fejro1/etfs_physical_certificate_or_drs/,1726085239.0,"
Hi everyone,

I’m evaluating whether to hold my ETFs as physical stock certificates or in a digital registered form (DRS). Both options are offered by my brokerage with the same fees, and I'm curious about the practical implications of each choice.

I'm particularly interested in the security and risk associated with physical certificates, especially in terms of reissuance if lost. Given that these shares wouldn't update on the physical certificate under a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), how well does this system work in practice? How are dividends managed—do I receive direct deposits, or will I get notifications from the transfer agent?

My preference for physical certificates stems from wanting to avoid the transactional pressure of brokerage UIs, which seem designed to encourage frequent trading. I’m interested in long-term, focused investing without these distractions.

Could anyone share their experiences or insights on:

* Security measures for protecting physical certificates.
* Any legal or tax differences encountered with physical vs. digital holdings.
* How long-term accessibility might be affected by opting for physical certificates.

I appreciate your help and respect everyone’s investment choices. If you're more inclined to question this approach rather than offering advice, please consider this a call for experiences and insights only.

Thanks in advance!"
Why is the $3000 capital loss deduction so low?,LarBrd33,270,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fejp13/why_is_the_3000_capital_loss_deduction_so_low/,1726085060.0,"I get you can apply capital losses against capital gains to minimize your taxable gains.

I get that there is a $3000 capital loss deduction where if your losses exceed your gains, you can apply $3000 against your ordinary income.  

I just don't get why that value is so low.  Like, one year I took over 100k in losses (sounds worse than it was) and I suppose if I never were to have gains, I could just apply it against $3000 in annual income for the next 33 years.  $3000 seems like such a small amount, though.  I asked ChatGPT:

&gt;The **$3,000 capital loss deduction limit** has remained unchanged for individuals since it was established under the **Tax Reform Act of 1976**. Since then, the limit has neither increased nor decreased, even though inflation has eroded its value over time. The limit was originally set at $3,000 to allow taxpayers to offset other income with investment losses, but it has not been adjusted for inflation in the decades since its introduction.

Adjusted for inflation, $3000 in today's dollars would be $16,583.83.    That amount makes a lot more sense to me.   Why hasn't this been increased in decades?  "

Academic concepts like ""stock beta"" make zero sense no matter how I try to rationalise it.

A few years ago, I also came across Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP) which shows equities have outperformed debt significantly (by 5% to 8%) even when considering survivorship bias. There are studies with over 100 years of data. Since survivorship bias cannot explain EPP, I concluded that perhaps humans are just not very good at pricing equities fairly relative to debt and overcompensate for the risk of equities.

Right now, it seems like every stock is expensive and I'm wondering if this is going to be the new normal. As technology gets better thus access to public information (e.g. company info, economic news, world events, etc) gets easier, and more younger people learning about investing online (since schools around the world don't teach personal finance ever), are equity prices just going to be priced higher (i.e. lower ERP) because now the equity market gets more competitive?

Should I switch to a fee vs. % based investment firm?,-McSlizzy-,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fd084v/should_i_switch_to_a_fee_vs_based_investment_firm/,1725915275.0,"I currently have \~$150k sitting with an investment firm that charges 1%. I realize this is a pittance to most firms. The returns aren't great and appear to be on autopilot / not actively managed. For this I pay $390/quarter, like clockwork as well. This account consists solely of old 401k's which I rolled over. I don't really have any huge life things to plan for minus retirement. Should I switch from % based to something else?

EDIT: Yeah, so sounds like I’m getting kind of screwed. What avenue do I use to transfer the account to a self managed one without tax implications? Is it something I can do myself, or should I pay someone? I have Schwab and Fidelity for other accounts if it matters. Y’all rock 🤘"
ESPP transition to ROTH IRA?,TravRado1024,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fcz8jt/espp_transition_to_roth_ira/,1725912866.0,"Hey All -

I recently enrolled in my company's new ESPP program, in which I purchase each pay period (biweekly), and receive 15% off of the current stock price at that time of purchase. Is there a benefit to me rolling that over to my traditional IRA and then over to my Roth IRA biweekly? (I do the backdoor ROTH IRA process)

Or is there a better way to capitalize on my earnings?

New to this whole thing, so any advice is appreciated. Thanks

Edit to add: I already max out my employer contribution to my 401k + some"
ETF investing - market spread fees,HappyPints,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fcx9a9/etf_investing_market_spread_fees/,1725908183.0,"So I invest £40 every 2 weeks into SPY (I’m a small time, passive investor).

I’ve noticed in my trading account that despite depositing £40, and placing a market order, sometimes the actual trade starts at around £38, some of my trades even started off as low as £37.50 - which means that the trade has to increase by 8% just to break even.

I believe this is the market spread fee, does this seem pretty high? Or does this seem about right?

I use eToro, which has a small currency conversion (£ &gt; $), but other than that, they don’t charge any transaction fee etc."

Investing for Kids and teaching them - recommended Apps and also situational advice,babbagack,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fcuzov/investing_for_kids_and_teaching_them_recommended/,1725902595.0,"Fortunately the kids are blessed with some birthday or holiday money from time to time.  And they would literally spend $50-100 on Roblox if they could.

I want to teach them the habit of being charitable, spending on oneself, and investing.  The last one is something I didn't catch onto until much later in life.  

I fortunately already have investment accounts for them in an ETF that gets invested into quarterly, not tons but it is fortunately something.

I want them the ability to see their money grow, but I don't know if it is wise to show them their personal investment accounts right now that I have set up for them (they are younger kids), but instead later in life when they are near college or so.

Should I just find some ""kid friendly"" app they can put on their tablet and put part of their gift money into over time, or should I just share those investment accounts with the kids now and have them add to the already existing bigger pool?

The latter makes more over time of course for them, by a little, but maybe it is better to just have them have their own little accounts/apps?

I don't know what app/s are good to use, appreciate any recommendation. I use fidelity for retirement and stuff, and have some other accounts I plan to get into fidelity as well.  Apparently they have some kids app but I have not looked into it yet"
